# inAudible
Among the ffmpeg library's versatile options is the ability to remove DRM
from .aa and .aax files. However, command line programs can be intimidating
and cryptic. inAudible eliminates the intimidation and also adds several
other features. Unfortunately, inAudible is currently only available on
torrenting sites. Torrenting is a way of distributing any kind of file but
it has a bad reputation due to being a popular method of pirating media and
software. This gives many people pause about obtaining inAudible even
though it is neither pirated nor illegal. Also, torrenting sites are
sometimes blocked by work, schools, public hotspots, and internet
providers. This can make it impossible to obtain inAudible.

This github repository makes available the inAudible install files.
